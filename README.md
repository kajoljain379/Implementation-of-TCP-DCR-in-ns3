# Implementation TCP-DCR algorithm in ns3
## Course Code: CS821	<br/>
## Assignment: #3	<br/>
### Overview		<br/>
TCP-DCR makes
simple modifications to the TCP congestion control algorithm to make it more
robust to non-congestion events. The key idea here is to delay the congestion
response of TCP for a short interval of time , thereby creating room for local recovery
mechanisms to handle any non-congestion events that may have occurred.
If at the end of the delay , the event is not handled, then it is treated as a congestion
loss.
